511145.b4687	shoB	26	Small toxic protein ShoB; Toxic component of a type I toxin-antitoxin (TA) system. May be a toxic protein; overexpression causes cessation of growth and rapid membrane depolarization. Overexpression induces stress- response and a number of membrane protein genes
511145.b4689	rzoQ	84	Putative lipoprotein RzoQ; Completely contained in another CDS
511145.b4703	pmrR	29	Putative membrane protein PmrR; May bind to BasS and modulate its sensor kinase activity
511145.b4705	mntS	42	Small protein MntS; Required for repression of mntH by MntR. May function as a chaperone that makes manganese more available by delivering it to the necessary cellular locations when manganese is limiting
511145.b4706	iroK	21	Protein IroK; Possible increased expression of this protein (due to mutations upstream of the start codon) is proposed to be responsible for resistance to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP)
