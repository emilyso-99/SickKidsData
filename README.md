#EMILY'S README
This repo contains the following:

A PostGres database containing information about various proteins in the microbiome. Proteins can be related in function by orthology, originally determined by sequence similarity. Therefore, I have created a relational database that, drawing orthology predictions from various metatranscriptomic databases, will create new orthology predictions for proteins in an RNA sample, beloning to bacteria in the microbiome. I designed and populated the database myself, as well as wrote the script for manipulating it to produce the correct output
